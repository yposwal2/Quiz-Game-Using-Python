<h1>Quiz Game using Python</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This code is a Python program that implements a quiz game with five multiple-choice questions.The program begins with a welcome message and prompts the user to choose whether they want to play the quiz game or not. If the user enters 'N', the program exits, otherwise, it starts the game. The game consists of five questions, and for each question, the program prompts the user with the question and waits for an answer. If the user answers correctly, the program increments the 'count' variable by 1 and prints a "Correct!" message. Otherwise, it prints an "Incorrect!" message.
After all five questions have been asked, the program prints a message thanking the user for playing and displays the number of correct answers they got out of 5.
